# Keras - House Price Prediciton

## Introduction :writing_hand:
This project demonstrates my proficiency in Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, and Seaborn for data cleaning, visualization, and prediction on the Kaggle House Prices competition. The primary objective of this project is to showcase my skills in data preparation and mining. Additionally, it highlights my knowledge of deep learning techniques and my ability to leverage them for forecasting purposes.

My Python code and model are available in the 'keras_prediction.ipynb' file, where I have demonstrated how I cleaned the data and developed my model for house price prediction.

## Result :brain:
